# Contributing

If you'd like to help out, thanks! We use Visual Studio 2022 for development, though any standard .NET 5 development environment should work. Please read through these guidelines to get started:

- Read through the ARCHITECTURE.md file to understand how csharprepl works. Depending on what you want to do, changes to the underlying PrettyPrompt library may be required.
- For new features, please open an issue first to discuss and design the feature. This will help reduce the chance of conflicting designs.
- Please include an xunit test, and ensure any code warnings and nullability issues are resolved.

Thanks!
